# Product List & Checkout Interface

This project is a simple Product List and Checkout Interface built with a responsive design to allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, view their cart, and proceed with a checkout process. It features dynamic product fetching, cart management, and a summary of the checkout process.

## Features

### Product List

### Cart Management

- **Dynamic Cart Count**: The cart count is updated dynamically as items are added.
- **View Cart**: Display all items added to the cart, showing:
  - Product Name

  - Total for each product
- **Update Quantity**: Users can modify the quantity of items in the cart, with the total price updating automatically.
- **Clear Cart**: Provides an option to clear the cart completely.

### Checkout Process
